Hi, I'm Ibbie 🤎.

I'm a designer based in Seattle, passionate about design for all.

Currently I'm @SeattleIndianHealthBoard, a Native focused clinic/advocacy org, where I support with everything design as we work on addressing systemic racism, inequity, and fixing all of the world's ills.

#### Skills

I am great at:

- thinking in graphic systems,
- collaboration,
- finding solutions,
- being me,
- and being there for you.
