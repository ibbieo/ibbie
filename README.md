Hi, I'm Ibbie 👋🏾. I'm a designer based in Seattle, passionate about design for all.

What am I great at

+ Thinking in graphic systems,
+ collaboration,
+ finding solutions,
+ being me,
+ and being there for you.

> Right now I'm @SeattleIndianHealthBoard, a Native focused clinic/advocacy org, where I support with everything design as we work on addressing systemic racism, inequity, and fixing all of the world's ills.
